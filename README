This version fixes a bad behaviour when trying to launch a non-executable script
and adds a default script output sorting in the tooltip by frequency order.

This version uses a mutex for tooltip refresh. This is safer.

Example scripts are in the scripts directory.
All given scripts are released into the public domain
You must modify it in order to fit your needs (HOSTNAME, etc..)
To make a script, read the introduction at http://brouits.free.fr/nall
and don't forget the script filename is important to nall (NNtitle)
- happy hacking.

This version of nall is unstable (and ugly) but... work.
Be careful on the private data of your scripts: make them chmod 700.

		nall: notify everything in a discrete tooltip
			http://brouits.free.fr/nall/

2008-12-29
This version fixes a bad behaviour when trying to launch a non-executable script
and adds a default output sorting in the tooltip by frequency order.

This version uses a mutex for tooltip refresh. This is safer.

Example scripts are in the scripts directory.
All given scripts are released into the public domain
You must modify them in order to fit your needs (HOSTNAME, etc..)
Then you can move them into ~/.nall/ and chmod them as 0700 in order
to not let other people to see your (probable) passwords used in them.
To make a script, read the introduction at http://brouits.free.fr/nall
and don't forget the script filename is important to nall (NNtitle)

This version of nall is unstable (and ugly) but... work.
Be careful on the private data of your scripts: make them chmod 700.
- happy hacking.

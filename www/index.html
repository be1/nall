<h1>Nall! a simple, non-intrusive, everything notifier in the system tray</h1>
</center>
<p>
Nall is a small gtk+ application that discretely fits into your freedesktop system tray (such as <em>trayer</em>, <em>stalonetray</em>, <em>gnome-panel</em>, ...). Its purpose is to spawn periodically every kind of script and display a one-line output in the tooltip window. The main usage of nall is monitoring or just notifying of almost everything (it just depends upon your imagination and ability to script).
<p>
Why nall ? because i wanted to notify myself in a simple way some networked drives, plus check my emails and know the title of the music i was listening to on my last.fm radio. The genericity of nall allow you to use also <a href="http://nagios.org/">Nagios Plugins</a> to monitor various resources.
Nall should run on any POSIX operating system, having a freedesktop aware trayer.
<h2>Download</h2>
<p>
Nall is free software, released under the GNU GPL version 2. See the COPYING file in the source archive.
If you want to contribute (provide scripts, package it, edit a manpage...), don't hesitate to!
just download it an hack at your pleasure, then send me your commits.
</p>
<p>
Well, <em>nall</em> has a <a href="git://github.com/be1/nall.git">git repository</a> where everybody can easily get the latest version and contribute to it. And even if you don't develop in C, you can add to the project your own <em>nall scripts</em> (nagios-plugins wrappers, USB teapot probe, rss checker...) and docs! For the latest changelog, <a href="http://github.com/be1/nall/tree/master">browse nall code on github</a>. To configure the github version, use the <em>bootsrap.sh</em> script instead of the usual <em>configure</em> script.
</p>
<h2>How to install it</h2>
<p>
You will need the <em>development files</em> of <em>libgtk+2.0</em>, <em>libglib-2.0</em> and <em>libnotify1</em> provided by your distro (this will also provide the <em>pkg-config</em> files). Untar the archive and go to its directory.
For Debian based distros, this resumes to:<br>
<tt>
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential libgtk2.0-dev libglib2.0-dev libnotify-dev<br>
$ tar -zxf nall-1.0.tar.gz<br>
$ cd nall-1.0<br>
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr #or defaults to /usr/local/bin<br>
$ make &amp;&amp; make install<br>
</tt>
<h2>Example script</h2>
<p>
Note that <u>nall won't run alone</u>: you must provide it some scripts either as command-lines in the configuration box, either as executable files e.g. in the <em>~/.nall</em> directory, and set their path in the configuration box. 
A nall script must return only one line of output, if possible.
Here is an example of script that checks emails through an IMAP server:<br>
<tt>
$ cat ~/.nall/imap.sh<br>
#!/bin/sh<br>
{<br>
echo X login brouits secretpass<br>
sleep 1<br>
echo X select inbox<br>
sleep 1<br>
echo X logout<br>
} | telnet imap.free.fr 143 2&gt;/dev/null | grep RECENT | tail -1<br>
</tt><br>
<p>
Got it ? have fun!

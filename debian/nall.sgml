<!-- Process this file with docbook-to-man to generate an nroff manual
     page: `docbook-to-man manpage.sgml > manpage.1'.  You may view
     the manual page with: `docbook-to-man manpage.sgml | nroff -man |
     less'.  A typical entry in a Makefile or Makefile.am is:

manpage.1: manpage.sgml
	docbook-to-man $< > $@


	The docbook-to-man binary is found in the docbook-to-man package.
	Please remember that if you create the nroff version in one of the
	debian/rules file targets (such as build), you will need to include
	docbook-to-man in your Build-Depends control field.

    <title>DESCRIPTION</title>

    <para>This manual page documents briefly the
      <command>&dhpackage;</command> command.</para>

    <para>This manual page was written for the &debian; distribution
      because the original program does not have a manual page.
		</para>

    <para><command>&dhpackage;</command> is a program that spawns
		periodically user-made scripts or command-lines and then displays
		information returned by them into a tooltip over the notification area 
		of the desktop's system-tray. The main usage of nall is monitoring or
		just notifying of anything the user has made a script to.
		</para>

    <title>OPTIONS</title>

    <para>This program has no option.
		The scripts to spawn are set through the "Manage Scripts" graphical menu.
